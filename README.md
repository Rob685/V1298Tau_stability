# V1298Tau_stability
Repository for V1298Tau stability constraints

`project_main.ipynb` shows all of the process of the project and produces all the figures

`ln_like_sampler.py` is the rejection sampling script.

The data folder contains the rejection posteriors and the stability posteriors, named by the number of samples drawn and which priors on the mass of planet b we used. The stability posteriors folder also contains the SPOCK probabilities for each of the configurations since these take hours to compute.
